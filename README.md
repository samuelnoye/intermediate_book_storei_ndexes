# intermediate_book_storei_ndexes
In this project, we’ll look at how adding more complex indexes can help (or hurt!) your database. Let’s imagine we are running an online book store and need to keep track of what books we offer. We’ll be working with a database of three tables. The books table is created from the top selling books of all time. The customers and orders tables are randomly generated.  As a note, this project will most likely run slower for you than most other projects in codeacademy. In order to see the benefits of an index, you need a large database. We tried to make the database as small as possible but still large enough to get a benefit of creating good indexes.
